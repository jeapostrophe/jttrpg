@title{Woah!}
@author{@author+email["Jay McCarthy" "jay.mccarthy@gmail.com"]}

This document describes @emph{Woah!}, the tabletop role-playing game I
play with my kids and friends. It is deliberately described in an
abstract way, because we apply it to different scenarios and settings
as our taste changes. It attempts to have strategic thinking, with
lots of creativity in general.

@table-of-contents[]

@section{Basics}

This is a game wherein a group of @T{players} (the @T{play group})
collaboratively tell a story (called the @T{fiction}) using
@T{mechanical} rules to adjudicate creative disputes and direct the
story in an unexpected direction.

This document refers to the story as the @DT{fiction}. In this game,
the @T{fiction} is the most important part. It is the place where the
action and fun takes place. The @T{play group} should try to be true
to the @T{fiction} at all times and keep it on the front of their
minds. The world of @T{fiction} is called the @DT{flavor} and all
aspects of the @T{fiction} that are not directly @T{mechanical} are
referred to as @T{flavor}.

The @DT{mechanical} rules are the particular rules of the game having
to do with numbers, cards, statistics, and so on. They exist to
adjudicate disputes between members of the @T{play group}, such as
when one @T{player} wants the hero to save the damsel and another
@T{player} wants the damsel to have already defeated the monster. They
also exist to introduce unexpected happenings in the story, so that
the @T{play group} can discover what happens in the @T{fiction}
through play.

A @DT{play group} is a @T{gamemaster} and multiple @T{leads}
controlled by @DT{players}. A @DT{lead} is an important character in
the @T{fiction} controlled by a human @T{player}. The
@DT{gamemaster} (or @DT{GM}) controls the rest of the universe and
adjudicates between @T{leads}.

@section{Mechanics}

This section explains the @T{mechanical} rules.

@margin-note{By re-drawing when there is only one card left, this
allows @T{leads} to strategically save high cards for important
circumstances.}

The @T{play group} has a deck of normal playing cards, called the
@DT{deck}.The @T{deck} is divided into two partitions: the @DT{draw
pile} and the @DT{discard pile}. At the start of a play session, the
@T{discard pile} is empty and each @T{lead} is dealt a @DT{hand} of
@HOW-BIG-HANDs cards from the @T{draw pile}. After a @T{lead} uses a
card, the card is put in the @T{discard pile}. Once the @T{lead}'s
@T{hand} contains fewer than two cards, they draw cards from the
@T{draw pile} until they have @HOW-BIG-HANDs cards in their @T{hand},
reshuffling the @T{discard pile} when the @T{draw pile} is exhausted.

The @DT{suit} of the cards is relevant in play. Each @T{suit}
corresponds to an @T{attribute} and has an @T{opposed suit} based on
the @T{opposed attribute}.

@subsection[#:tag "bm"]{Basic Mechanic}

The @DT{basic mechanic} is for a @T{lead} to describe their action. If
the action could be done by any normal person in the circumstances,
then no @T{test} is needed. However, if some special circumstance or
special ability is required, the @T{player} makes a @T{test}. The
result of a @T{test} is a @T{consequence}.

@subsection{Consequences}

A @DT{consequence} is either @T{success}, @T{partial}, or @T{failure}.

On a @DT{success}, the action is successful and the @T{player}
controls the story for a little bit, narrating the results of their
successful action. (Occasionally it is more appropriate for the
@T{gamemaster} to narrate.)

On a @DT{partial}, the main result is accomplished but there are some
negative results, collaboratively determined by the @T{gamemaster} and
@T{player}. Often it is best for the @T{gamemaster} to give a few
options, let the @T{player} decide which ones happen, and then
narrate.

On a @DT{failure}, the @T{gamemaster} chooses and narrates the
negative results.

In general, results should always flow from the @T{fiction}. The story
is most interesting when the @T{leads} don't get their way
exactly. So, on a success, the @T{gamemaster} should look for a way to
give the player a hard choice of two good things out of three
possibilities, while on a partial success, they can only choose one.

There are no strict rules for what consequences are. The only
principle is that: on a @T{success}, you get what you want with only
soft consequences@";" on a @T{partial}, you get most of what you want
with maybe a hard consequence@";" and on a @T{failure}, you don't get
what you want and experience hard consequences.

@subsection{Tests}

Each test is associated with an @T{attribute} corresponding to the
kind of action that is being performed, and that action's @T{suit} is
called the @DT{test suit}.

There are two variants of @DT{tests}: @T{displays}, for when one
@T{lead} is involved, and @T{contests}, for when multiple @T{leads}
compete.

@subsubsection{Displays}

In a @DT{display}, the @T{lead} selects a card from their @T{hand} and
uses it. The @T{GM} selects the next card from the @T{draw pile}. Each
card is inspected after incorporating all applicable @T{modifiers}.

If the @T{lead}'s card is a @card{Face} card @bold{AND} is greater than or
equal to the @T{GM}'s card, then the @T{display} is a @T{success}.

If the @T{lead}'s card is a @card{Face} card @bold{XOR} is greater than or
equal to the @T{GM}'s card, then the @T{display} is a @T{partial}.

Otherwise, the @T{display} is a @T{failure}.

@bold{Example:} Jean is researching the toxin sample discovered in the
body of the victim and plays a @card{Eight}, the @T{GM} draws a
@card{Seven}, so he learns that it is extra-terrestrial in origin, but
destroys the sample in the process.

@bold{Example:} Elizabeth attacks the screen ogre with her scathing
wit and plays a @card{King}, the @T{GM} draws a @card{King}, so
Elizabeth shatters the ogre and continues the day victorious.

@subsubsection{Contests}

In a @DT{contest}, there are @racket[n] participants which are all
@T{lead}s. Each participant selects a card from their @T{hand} to use
and place face down in front them. (No card should be revealed
until all @T{lead}s have selected a card.) The cards are revealed and
then ordered after incorporating all applicable @T{modifiers}. The
player of the unique highest card has a @T{success}. The player of the
unique lowest card has a @T{failure}. The players of all cards in the
middle have a @T{partial}. @margin-note{A @T{contest} involving two
participants never has a @T{partial} result for either.}

@bold{Example:} Pete, Chloe, and Lana---all @T{leads}---race across
the room to grab the fallen meteor rock. Pete chooses a @card{Jack},
Chloe chooses a @card{Queen}, and Lana plays the @card{Seven}. Chloe
reaches the rock first, Pete gets across the room but not in time,
while Lana's jacket is stuck on the cappuccino machine and it is
tumbling towards her.

@subsubsection{Meta Notes}

@bold{Optional Note:} If you leave the @card{Joker} in the deck, then
whenever it is drawn, make it a catastrophic, scene-changing
@T{failure}.

@bold{Strategic Note:} @T{Leads} know which cards have already been
played and which have not, so they have a fuzzy estimate of what cards
they may go up against. Similarly, they have an idea of where their
strengths and weakness lay, so they can decide how much to commit to
each action. Given the bias towards @card{Face} cards, they can ensure
some kind of @T{success} when it counts.

@bold{Gamemastering Note:} The @T{gamemaster} never directly opposes
the players strategically, because non-@T{lead}s always have their
card randomly chosen.

@subsection{Lead Statistics}

Each @T{lead} has a few @T{mechanical} concepts associated with them:
@T{attributes}, @T{hit box}es, and @T{tag}s.

@subsubsection{Attributes}

@ack["https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/matthewjhanson/the-fastest-rpg-ive-ever-played-abstract-dungeon"]{Abstract Dungeon}

A @T{lead} has four @DT{attributes}, which are each associated with a
@T{suit} in the @T{deck} as well as various actions and
qualities. Each @T{attribute} has an @DT{opposed attribute} and an
@DT{opposed suit}.

       @t{@T{Agility}}
       @t{@card{Spades}}))
]

A @T{lead} has an @DT{attribute modifier} associated with each
@T{attribute}, which is a number between @litchar{-2} and
@litchar{+2}.

@subsubsection{Hit Boxes}

A @T{lead} has a certain number of @DT{hit box}es, representing their
ability to deal with adversity.

When a @T{lead} fails to avoid adversity, then they fill in one @T{hit
box} with a negative @T{tag} related to the particular
circumstance. The @T{tag} should be written inside the box and must be
dealt with before it may be removed.

If all @T{hit box}es are filled in, then the character is ``down'' and
the direction of the adventure or campaign should change to address
the problem.

@bold{Example:} Tom blasts the crystal with his laser vision, but the
heat blast bounces off, hitting him in the eye, and blinding him. Tom
writes ``blind'' in one of his hit boxes.

@bold{Example:} Oscar opens the chest to reveal a viewing portal into
the Unseen Darkness where he sees The Undying One. The sight corrupts
Oscar's psyche and he writes ``neurotic'' in one of his hit boxes.

In principle, @T{hit box}es are not mechanically necessary because the
@T{tags} themselves are the in-@T{fiction} consequences of failure to
deal with adversity, but they are a useful abstraction to benchmark
failure.

's Google+ post}

@subsubsection{Tags}

A @DT{tag} is a statement, quality, resource, or attribute about a
@T{lead} that separates them from normal people of the world they live
in. Every @T{lead} has a list of @T{tag}s.

For example, a @T{tag} might be ``Can cast fire magic'' or ``Expert
computer hacker''. In the modern world, a @T{tag} would not be ``Has a
cell phone'' or ``Knows about germs'', but these things might be
@T{tag}s in a fantasy world.

Because @T{tags} are free-form statements, they can be positive,
neutral, negative, or any combination, depending on the
circumstances. Avoid very vague @T{tags} and try to be specific.

@T{Tags} can be permanent, temporary, fleeting, disposal, etc,
depending on the particular details of the @T{fiction} and setting.

In general, @T{tags} change what a @T{lead} can do and how well they
can do it. For example, in a story about soldiers, having a rifle is
likely not to be a @T{tag}, but ``Lost his rifle'' might be a @T{tag},
with the effect of disallowing the @T{lead} to fire. For example, in a
story about Greek myths, being a demigod is a @T{tag}, but speaking
Greek is not. For example, in a fantasy story about dungeons and
delves, having a sword might not be a @T{tag} but ``Has the mystical
blade Vorpalice'' is a @T{tag}.

@T{Tags} should have both @T{mechanical} and @T{flavor}
significance. They should influence how successful @T{leads} are, what
they can do, and what their goals, desires, and passions are.

Periodically throughout play, new @T{tags} should be given by the
@T{gamemaster}. They should be positive and negative @T{consequences}
for individual actions, as well as a result of pivotal story moments.

@subsection{Modifiers}

When a @T{lead} faces a @T{test} and plays a card, they incorporate a
variety of @DT{modifiers} to the value of the card.

First, they incorporate the @T{test suit} of the action. If the
@T{suit} of the card played matches the @T{test suit}, then a
@litchar["+1"] modifier is applied. If the @T{suit} of the card played
matches the @T{opposed suit} of the @T{test suit}, then a
@litchar["-1"] modifier is applied.

@bold{Example:} Alexa tries to sneak past the guards on her way into
the mansion. She plays a @card{Ten of Spades}, so it is equivalent to
a @card{Jack of Spades}, because @card{Spades} is the @T{test suit} of
sneaking. Thus, a @T{partial} is guaranteed, because she plays
a @card{Face} card.

Second, they incorporate the @T{attribute modifier} of the action.

@bold{Example:} Stewart tries to decipher the ancient writing. He
plays a @card{Queen of Clubs}, but it is considerate as a @card{Ten of
Clubs}, because it is in the @T{opposed suit} and he has a
@litchar["-1"] @T{attribute modifier} for @T{Intellect}. Thus, his
is not guaranteed a @T{partial}.

Third, they incorporate any applicable @T{tags}. A @T{tag} may imply
that an action is easier or harder for the @T{lead}. If it is easier,
then a @litchar["+1"] modifier is applied. If it is harder, then a
@litchar["-1"] modifier is applied.

@bold{Example:} Elizabeth tries to commune with the ghost of The
Jackal. She plays a @card{Queen}, but because she possesses the @T{tag},
``Speaker for the dead'', it is as though she played a @card{King} and
her @T{success} is guaranteed.

@subsection{Lead Creation}

When you create a @T{lead}, you should start by defining the @T{flavor} of
the character. Then, select the following @T{mechanical} details:

@itemlist[#:style 'ordered

@item{@T{Attribute modifiers} --- Choose a modifier for each
@T{attribute}. They should total to @litchar["+0"] for a low-power
story, @litchar["+1"] for a high-power story, and @litchar["+2"] for
an epic story.}

@item{@T{Hit box}es --- Choose a number between @litchar["2"] and
@litchar["4"]. A normal person would have @litchar["1"], but @T{leads}
are typically exceptional, so a weaker @T{lead} still has
@litchar["2"]. Someone truly sturdy has @litchar["4"].}

@item{@T{Tags} --- Choose a few @T{tags}, focusing mainly on positive
or generally descriptive ones. Add one or two negative @T{tags}.  You
should have one or two for your archetype and background, one or two
for a special quality, and one or two for any special resources.}

]

@bold{Example:} Sally Summers is the Zombie Slayer, a mythical role
filled each generation by one teenage girl in all the world. She
fights with the enchanted whip, @italic{Lightbringer}, and has a
mystical connection to the spirits of past Slayers. Her attribute
modifiers are @litchar["+1"] @T{Toughness}, @litchar["+0"]
@T{Agility}, @litchar["+0"] @T{Intellect}, and @litchar["+0"]
@T{Spirit}. She has @litchar["3"] @T{hit box}es. Her initial @T{tags}
are, ``The Zombie Slayer'', ``Possesses @italic{Lightbringer}'',
``High school girl'', ``Prideful'', and ``Mystic knowledge from past
lives''.

@bold{Variant Note:} The @T{hit box} suggestion above is tuned for
representing short-term adversity, like damage and fighting spirit. If
instead you wish to represent long-term adversity, like general health
and mental wellness, you will want to tweak the scale. You want to
have both kinds of @T{hit box}es, although normally long-term
adversity shows up in the form of @T{tags}.

@subsection{Actions}

There are no strict rules for @DT{actions}. In general, describe the
activity in the @T{fiction}, then apply the @secref["bm"] and think
critically about what @T{attribute} is appropriate and what @T{tags}
apply.

The @T{consequences} of @T{tests} may have @T{mechanical} impacts. In
particular, it is common that a @T{consequence} is to gain or lose a
@T{tag} or to fill-in a @T{hit box}.

@bold{Example:} Sarai fails to convince the border guards of her
identity, so her supplies are stolen and she is forced back into the
wilderness. She adds the ``Basic goods stolen'' @T{tag}. (She did not
have ``Possesses basic goods'' before because this can be assumed. The
unique circumstance is missing these things.) Later, when she visits a
frontier town and works for the tavern, she removes this @T{tag}
because she is back on her feet.

@bold{Example:} Joffrey fires a flurry of arrows at the approaching
vampire horde, but fails miserably. He adds the @T{tag}, ``No more
arrows'', and thus can no longer use his long bow.

Inside of single scenes and stories, it should be common to introduce
and remove @T{tag}s for all of the @T{lead}s.

@subsection{Combat}

There is no need to treat combat encounters and combat actions
differently than other scenes and @T{actions}. However, if your
@T{play group} wants something slightly more @T{mechanical}, use the
ideas in this section.

@bold{Initiative.} At the beginning of a combat scenario, have each
@T{lead} use a card that represents their readiness for the fight
and (potentially) draw cards for non-@T{lead} participants. The
relative ranking of the cards will determine the order in which
subsequent actions take place.

@bold{Preparation.} Use the @bold{Initiative} card as a constant
@T{modifier} throughout the battle: Add it to all cards that are used.

@bold{Range.} As an in between point to a purely verbal battleground
and the highly detailed miniature-oriented play of a board game, use
an abstracted battleground with abstract areas like, @italic{Close
Quarters}, @italic{Behind}, @italic{Flanking}, @italic{The Fray},
@italic{In The Distance} etc. Use @T{actions} to move from one to
another. Make it impossible to use @T{actions} on targets in distant
areas. Give a @litchar["-1"] @T{modifier} for using @T{actions} in
adjacent areas.

@section{Flavor}

This section gives advice on choosing the @T{flavor} of the
@T{fiction}. There are no strict rules here, so just be inspired and
have fun. The entire @T{play group} should discuss these points
together.

We divide our discuss into four sections:
@itemlist[#:style 'ordered

@item{@secref["flav-set"] --- The world in which the @T{fiction} takes
place.}

@item{@secref["flav-char"] --- The @T{lead} characters of the
@T{fiction}.}

@item{@secref["flav-camp"] --- The overall narrative of the entire
@T{fiction} that stretches across all of the occasions the @T{play
group} meets.}

@item{@secref["flav-stories"] --- The narratives of each individual
session of play.}

]

@bold{Advice:} I recommend thinking about the @T{flavor} in this
order, but it is not strictly necessary. I normally start a new
@T{play group} with a discussion of what kind world they want to play
in. Then, we talk about who the stars of the story (@T{leads})
are. Next, we think about the overall kind of story we want to
create. Then I start thinking about what each of the component stories
will be.

@subsection[#:tag "flav-set"]{Settings}

I normally start by picking an existing work of fiction that I want to
start from and going from there. Other times, I like to answer a
serious of questions that describe the contours of the world.

@bold{Style.} What style of world is it?
Fantastic. Silly. Gritty. Realistic. Optimistic. Pessimistic. Mythic.

@bold{Period.} When does the @T{fiction} take place?
Jurassic. Modern. Old West. Futuristic. Medieval. Dark Ages. Bronze
Age. Mythic. Iron Age. Space-Age. Age of Sail. Cold War.

@bold{Special Qualities.} What are some special things about the
world? Super Heroes. Post-apocalypse. Dystopia. Magic. Time-travel.
Zombies. Dinosaurs. Vampires. Aliens. Monsters. Points-of-Light. Talking
Animals.

@bold{Scale.} What is the scale of the world that the @T{fiction}
takes place in? Small town. City. High school. Colony
Ship. Planet. Continent. Country. Galaxy.

@bold{Genres.} Does the @T{fiction} fit an existing genre? High
fantasy. Comic fantasy. Contemporary fantasy. Spiritual fantasy. Bug
hunt. Space
opera. Weird. Horror. Pulp. Slasher. Baroque. Supernatural. Ghost
stories. Mystery. Espionage. War. Western. Martial
Arts. Egyptian. Ancient Greece. Weird West. Space 1889. Weird War
III. The Dark Elder Gods. The Dark Continent.

@subsection[#:tag "flav-char"]{Characters}

The most important part of the @T{fiction} is the characters and the
setting just exists to place them on a canvas. When coming up with
characters, think about a few different things:

@bold{Archetype.} What story archetype do they fulfill? The Chosen
One. The Outsider. The White Knight. The Dark Prince.

@bold{Background.} Where do they come from? A small town. The royal
family. The best school. An orphan. From another place.

@bold{Code.} What standards to they uphold as a guiding force in their
life? Uphold the law. Never lie. Family. Duty. Honor. Survival of the
fittest. Loyalty. Always pays their debts.

@bold{Motivation.} What motivates their actions in the story? What do
they quest for? Revenge. Glory. Honor. Duty. An ancient
artifact. Family. Love.

@bold{Job.} What is their job? Police officer. Scientist. Soldier. Cook.
Researcher. Librarian. Adviser. Diplomat. Trader. Guard. Knight. Retail.

@bold{Training.} What special training do they have?
Weapons. Science. Magic. Computers. Research. Geography. Animals.

@subsection[#:tag "flav-camp"]{Campaigns}

Once you know the world that you are in, you should determine the
whole story of the @T{fiction}. I like to think of the campaign as a
season of a TV show. Here are some ideas:

@bold{War.} There is a war that has started or will start and the
@T{lead}s need to do something to stop it, win it, turn the tables,
etc.

@bold{Exploration.} The world is much bigger than the @T{lead}s
realized and they are driven to explore it and see the undiscovered
country.

@bold{Quest for the.} There is some important artifact in the world
that must be found, acquired, used, or brought to safety. Do they know
where it is? Do they know what it is?

@bold{Hero's Journey.} The @T{lead}s must leave comfort and undergo
trials before they return.

@bold{The Big Bad on the Horizon.} There is a big bad on the horizon
that must be prepared for and stopped.

@subsection[#:tag "flav-stories"]{Stories}

Your campaign is made of many stories. It works well to plan a few key
moments and the kinds of things that need to happen, then let the
@T{fiction} lead some place interesting. If the campaign is a season
of a TV show, then each story is an episode. Most episodes will be
self-contained, but push the greater arc of the story too. Think about
having ``specials'' that incorporate interesting and different styles
as you go.

@section{Player Advice}

@subsection{Roleplaying Tips}

Have focus and keep to the point of the moment of narration. Be
concise and let others play.

Respect the other @T{lead}s and don't alter their behavior
significantly from their established patterns.

Stay consistent with the setting, campaign, and established parts of
the story. Occasionally a ret-con or plot-twist is appropriate.

Use a timer sometimes to make a moment tense and give the @T{leads}
only a short time to react.

Whenever you draw a @card{Joker}, have something unexpected happen!

You can play without a @T{gamemaster} by collaboratively filling their
role: any time you feel the need for a @T{gamemaster}, have the person
to the left of the @T{lead} in focus act as one temporarily. If you
remember to share the spotlight and respect each other, then it should
go smoothly. The major downside is that there will not be secretly
planned plot twists... or will there?

@subsection{Characters}

Use what other roleplaying games call ``classes'' to inspire your
characters. Here's a huge number of ideas:

Man. Mastermind. Mentor. Merchant
Prince. Metamorph. Mimic. Ogre. Overlord. Punk. Ronin. Shadow. Spellslinger. Star
Mage. Vampire Killer. Wanderer. Veteran. Witch. }

Use these tropes to come up with your character concept, as well as
your initial set of @T{tags}. You can also think about unique items
and attributes as another axis of @T{tags}. Here are some ideas:

@sentence-table[4]{ Magical Sense. Sword of Pure Darkness. Vanish into
another Dimension. Earth Gadget. Future Tech. Item out of
Time. Knowledge out of Time. Mysterious Power. Seedy
Connections. Legendary Sword. Oblivious to Manipulation. Special
Insight. Magical Little Friend. Flight. Great Store of Wealth. Fire
Breath. Ridiculously Strong. Ridiculously Old. Squad of
Retainers. Divine Visions. Healing Touch. Royal Privilege. Magical
Horse. Speak to Animals. Commune with Spirits. Has a Guardian
Angel. Haunted. Hunted. Unique
Cybersuit. Attractive. Ambidexterous. Brave. Linguist. Noble. Lucky. Ace. }

A further way to create interesting characters is to connect them to
each other and other people out in the world. Here are some ideas:

@sentence-table[2]{ They accidentally summoned you. You are
siblings. You have a dark secret that even you don't know. You were
friends as kids. They have a crush on you. They have a magical
artifact that affects you. They are actually your parent. They killed
your family member. A dark power sent you to them. You trained
together. You are secretly buddies but publicly enemies. You were
lovers. You are obsessed with them. You were set up with them,
butâ¦. They brought you out of the darkness. A dark power is after them
and only you know. They showed up on Earth and are responsible for
what happened to you. They took something from you. You had to find
them to save the world. They welcomed you when you came here for the
first time. They helped you do something shady once. They are
convinced you stole something from them. If you don't steal it,
someone will come after you. They are your rival. You've been through
thick and thin together. They constantly undermine you. They know
about your true destiny, but you don't. They want you to cast the
final ritual. They were apprenticed with you, but weren't as good as
you. You accidentally blew something up important to them. They fear
you will interfere with their plans. Your parents asked them to take
care of you. You are hopelessly in love with them. They served you in
the last war. You must acquire it at all costs. You were supposed to
receive it, but it was denied. They are your biggest fan. You know you
must protect them. They are wrong and need to know it. You were
commanded to do something you don't want. What you believe is
wrong. They are your sworn protector. They are destined to sacrifice
you. You need it to fulfill your destiny. They need your
guidance. They owe you for saving their life. Your holy quest is to
find it. They are in great danger. You protected them when they were
stranded. You know the legend of their past or future. }

Another way to think about your character is the dramatic situation
they find themselves in. This can define the character, a story, or
even the whole campaign.

@sentence-table[2]{ Overcoming the Monster. Rags to Riches. The
Quest. Voyage and
Return. Comedy. Tragedy. Rebirth. Supplication. Crime Pursued by
Vengeance. Pursuit. Obtaining. Self-Sacrifice for an
Ideal. Deliverance. Daring Enterprise. Returners. Abduction. The
Enigma. Recovery of a Lost One. Vengeance Taken for Kin Upon
Kin. Enmity of Kin. Rivalry of Kin. Slayer of Kin
Unrecognized. Self-Sacrifice for Kin. Necessity of Sacrificing Loved
Ones. Discovery of the Dishonor of a Loved One. Loss of Loved
Ones. Disaster. Revolt. Rivalry of Superior vs
Inferior. Ambition. Conflict with a God. Falling Prey to
Misfortune. Madness. Fatal Imprudence. Erroneous
Judgment. Remorse. Murderous Adultery. Involuntary Crimes of
Love. Sacrifice for Passion. Adultery. Crimes of Love. Obstacles to
Love. An Enemy Loved. Mistaken Jealousy.  }

@subsection[#:tag "adv-cons"]{Consequences}

The @T{gamemaster} should try to use @T{failure} to spin new ideas
into the story. Don't just have the obvious thing go wrong, but do
something new:

@sentence-table[3]{ Add a complication. Reveal future trouble. Capture
someone. Reintroduce an old foe with a new face. Reveal some
lore. Tempt them. Provide a clue. Take something away. Withhold, ruin,
or replace something they have. }

@subsection[#:tag "adv-act"]{Actions}

When @T{leads} take @T{actions}, it is more interesting to give the
@T{player} hard choices for how to put their @T{consequences} into the
@T{fiction}. Here are some templates for different kinds of actions:

@(struct *action (what fail-o partial-o succ-o opts))
@(define (action what fail-o partial-o succ-o [opts #f])
   (*action what fail-o partial-o succ-o opts))
@(define (render-result o opts)
  (match o
    [(? string?) o]
    [(? number?)
     @nested{Choose @(~a o) from the list of options:
                    @(for/list ([o (in-list opts)]
                                [i (in-naturals 1)])
                       (list @bold{(@(~a i))} " " o " "))}]
    [(cons o opts) (render-result o opts)]))
@(define (actions . x)
(tabular
 #:style 'boxed
 #:sep (hspace 2)
 #:column-properties '(left)
 #:row-properties '((bottom-border top))
 (cons
  (map bold (list "Action" "Fail" "Partial" "Success"))
  (for/list ([a (in-list (sort (filter *action? x) string<=? #:key *action-what))])
    (match-define (*action what fail-o partial-o succ-o opts) a)
    (list what
          (render-result fail-o opts)
          (render-result partial-o opts)
          (render-result succ-o opts))))))

              "There is a problem with what you got."

        (cons 2 (list "You manage to do it without getting hurt."

@section{Gamemaster Advice}

@subsection{Campaigns}

Before you start playing, set up the broad outlines of the campaign
and the story beats that you will hit. Follow a
@link["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-act_structure"]{Three-act
structure} and model it after a classic narrative structure like the
@link["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero's_journey"]{Hero's journey /
Monomyth}. Punctuate the acts with the reception of an important new
@T{tag} for each character that drastically changes their
capabilities. Put a few @DT{McGuffins} on their path that will
determine the difficulty of the ordeal, if they fall into the Big
Bad's hands.

Here's an example structure to apply based on
@link["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Writer%27s_Journey:_Mythic_Structure_for_Writers"]{Christopher
Vogler}'s interpretation of the
@link["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero's_journey"]{Hero's journey /

@subsection{Stories}

Within each session of play or story, create a

structure} within the episode. Within an episode, give out temporary
resources or @DT{clues} that will be used within the story, but are
not relevant for the campaign. Finish the story with a @T{tag} as a
reward or punishment and potentially a @T{McGuffin} being handed out.
